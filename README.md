A cookbook which helps with the setup of user accounts, groups and configures sudo access. Since it was added, it's been kind of replaced by Chef's version of the same thing in many respects. For the moment though, it's still used in various places.

# Support
We know the cookbook works on CentOS 6 and 7 and, whilst the tests are currently written for Chef 13, it was actually building successfully on Chef 15.7.32, the latest at the time. Therefore, we shouldn't really have any issues continuing using this if needs be.
